## Privacy

[FastCube](https://fastcube.vysinsky.cz) is developed by [Michal Vyšinský](https://vysinsky.cz/). I know privacy and security is important to user of FastCube and this Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, why we need it, and what we do with it. By using FastCube you agree to this policy.

### Analytics
In order to improve FastCube I may collect usage statistics, such as the number of users, how often they play etc. FastCube uses Google Analytics for Firebase to collect this analytics data and you can [find more information here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### Crash Logs
I do our best to find and fix software bugs before publishing new versions of the app. But, realistically, some bugs will slip through and may cause the FastCube app to crash. If this happens the app may send a crash log to help us find and fix the bug! FastCube uses Google Crashlytics to collect crash logs and you can [find more information here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

### Children's Privacy
You must be 13 years of age or older to use FastCube. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Moreover, if you are younger than 18, then your parent or legal guardian must read and accept this Privacy Policy on your behalf.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will notify you of any changes by publishing the new policy on this page. Any changes are effective immediately on publishing and you are advised to review this page periodically.
